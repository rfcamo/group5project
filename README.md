# Project Introduction
 COVID-19 - Data Assessment : group5project
 
Hello, 

Welcome to our data visualisation project. 

Our project will cover the effects of Covid-19 and it's impacts on: 

```
General population health (i.e. infections, deaths and recoveries)
```

```
Labour outcomes (unemployment rates) 
```

```
Human population movements (travel)
```

```
Mining, Oil and Gas (sector performances)
```


What we hope to show with our data is the below hypothesis: 
. Despite Covid-19, Australia continued to maintain high economic performance, with minimal depressions to its labour market.

Our antithesis would be: 
. That Australia did suffer economic decline, with greater depressions to its labour market.
