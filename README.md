# Project Introduction

Hello, 

Welcome to our data visualisation project. 

Our project name will simply be referred to as: COVID-19 - Data Assessment: group5project

Reasoning of topic choice: 
Almost everyone has been touched by Covid-19 in one way or another. 
Whether that is through the form of: restrictions, employment life and those personally dealing with the devistating disease, we wanted to create a snapshot into the true impacts of the virus.    

The project scope will cover : 
1. What is the impact of Covid-19 on Australia? 
2. What is the specific effect of Covid-19 on the macro-economy of Australia? 
3. Were there any differences between State and Territories? 

Acknowledgements
