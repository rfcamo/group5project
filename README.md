# Project Introduction

Hello, 

Welcome to our data visualisation project. 

Our project name will simply be referred to as: COVID-19 - Data Assessment: group5project

Reasoning of topic choice: 

Almost everyone has been touched by Covid-19 in one way or another. 
Whether that is through the form of: restrictions, employment life and those personally dealing with the devistating disease, we wanted to create a snapshot into the true impacts of the virus.    


Acknowledgements   
Scope of data: the sheer size of the macro economy meant we needed to decide on specific areas of measurement (e.g.) categories. 

Limitations of Data: this will not cover all industry sectors of business performance.


Categories to be used in this project

```
General population health (i.e. infections)
```

```
Labour outcomes (unemployment rates) 
```

```
Human population movements (travel)
```

```
Mining, Oil and Gas (sector performances)
```


Hypothesis

What we hope to show with our data is that Covid-19 had a significant negative effect on the afforementioned categories.

# Usage

# Questions
1. What is the impact of Covid-19 on Australia? 
2. What is the specific effect of Covid-19 on the macro-economy of Australia? 
3. Were there any differences between State and Territories?

# Analysis
 Our overall data assessment proved our hypothesis correct, with the exception of sector performance (mining, oil and gas); which actually experienced an increase in economic growth and productivity during the pandemic.
